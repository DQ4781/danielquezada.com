                            <h2 style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #003399;">Why I'm Reading More Fiction in 2025</h2>
                            <p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: gray;">Published on January 11, 2025</p>
                            
                            <div style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
                                <p>
                                    This year, I’m switching things up. For a while now, I’ve been all about non-fiction books—learning about the world, diving into different topics, and trying to expand my knowledge. But in 2025, I want to focus more on fiction.
                                </p>
                            
                                <p>
                                    It all started when I came across a video (if I find it again, I’ll link it) that really made me rethink my approach to reading. The video talked about how non-fiction is great for facts and direct knowledge, but it’s kind of limited in what it can give you. Non-fiction sticks to the facts—it explains how things work, what happened, or why something matters—but it doesn’t go much deeper than that.
                                </p>
                            
                                <p>
                                    Fiction, though, is a whole other game. Through stories, authors can explore ideas and experiences that might not fit neatly into the real world. They can share wisdom or truths through their characters—things they might not want to say outright in real life. And as readers, we get to see these characters live through struggles, growth, and decisions that can teach us a lot. It’s not the same as living those experiences firsthand, but it’s still something we can learn from.
                                </p>
                            
                                <p>
                                    I think that’s the big difference: non-fiction gives you knowledge, but fiction gives you perspective and wisdom. It lets you step into someone else’s shoes and see the world in a new way. And honestly, I feel like I’ve been missing out on that.
                                </p>
                            
                                <h3 style="color: #003399;">My Reading List</h3>
                                <p>
                                    So, this year, I’m diving into three big fiction books that have been on my list for a while:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Moby-Dick</strong> by Herman Melville: I’ve heard it’s a deep dive into obsession and ambition, and it feels like the kind of story that’ll make me think.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>The Count of Monte Cristo</strong> by Alexandre Dumas: A classic revenge story that everyone seems to love—plus, it’s got pirates, so that’s a win.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Gravity’s Rainbow</strong> by Thomas Pynchon: This one feels like a challenge, but I’ve heard it’s worth the effort. It’s supposed to be wild, weird, and packed with ideas.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            
                                <p>
                                    I know these aren’t exactly light reads, but that’s part of the point. Fiction makes you slow down and actually spend time with the story. You can’t just skim through it for the key takeaways like you might with a non-fiction book. And honestly, I think I could use that kind of focus right now.
                                </p>
                            
                                <p>
                                    I’m excited to see where these stories take me and what I learn from them. I’m still going to read some non-fiction when I’m in the mood, but this year, fiction’s getting the spotlight. Here’s to a year of great stories and new perspectives.
                                </p>
